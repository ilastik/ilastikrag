The ``ilastikrag`` package implements an ND Region Adjacency Graph (Rag) datastructure,
along with  algorithms to compute *features* for the edges between superpixels in the ``Rag``.
It has good performance, thanks to the `VIGRA <http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra>`_ image processing
library and the `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ data analysis package.
